## banckers

Here are some key points about the Banker's algorithm:

It is used to prevent deadlocks in a computer system by ensuring that resource allocation requests can be safely granted without causing a deadlock.
It uses a safety property, which is a sufficient condition for ensuring that there will never be a deadlock, to determine whether a new resource allocation request can be safely granted.
It maintains a table of the current resource allocation state and uses this information to make allocation decisions.
It requires that each process declare the maximum number of resources it may need in the future, in order to prevent a process from requesting resources it cannot subsequently release.
It can be implemented using a FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue or a priority queue to determine the order in which requests are granted.

## dinning algo

Here are some key points about the dining philosophers problem:

It is a classic problem in computer science that illustrates the challenges of concurrent access to shared resources.
It involves five philosophers sitting at a round table with five plates of food and five forks.
In order to eat, a philosopher must use the fork to the left and the right of their plate.
Without synchronization, the philosophers may all try to pick up the same fork at the same time, leading to a deadlock.
A synchronization mechanism must be implemented to ensure that only one philosopher can pick up a fork at a time.
